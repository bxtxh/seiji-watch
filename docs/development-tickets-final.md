## Strategic Approach

### Core Philosophy
- **Vertical Slices**: End-to-end features over horizontal layers
- **Pragmatic Architecture**: Simplified services for MVP with migration path
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early deployment, continuous integration, scope freeze
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks to July 22, 2025 with July 15 feature freeze

### Service Architecture (MVP ‚Üí Future)
**MVP (3 Services) - Updated for Airtable + Weaviate:**
- `ingest-worker`: Scraper + STT processing ‚Üí Airtable + Weaviate
- `api-gateway`: FastAPI with Airtable + Weaviate integration
- `web-frontend`: Next.js PWA

**Data Architecture (MVP):**
- **Structured Data**: Airtable (Bills, Members, Sessions, Speeches)
- **Vector Data**: Weaviate Cloud (Speech embeddings)
- **Binary Files**: Cloud Storage (Audio, PDFs)

**Post-MVP Migration Path:**
- Migrate from Airtable to PostgreSQL for complex queries
- Keep Weaviate or migrate to self-hosted vector solution
- Add separate `data-processor` service for complex analysis
- Implement `stt-worker` as independent service

## Architecture Migration Strategy

### Phase 1 (MVP): Embedded Vector Operations
```python
# api-gateway/vector_service.py
class VectorService:
    """Embedded vector operations with clear interface for future extraction"""
    
    async def generate_embedding(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
        # OpenAI API call
        
    async def similarity_search(self, query_vector: List[float], limit: int) -> List[SearchResult]:
        # pgvector query
```

### Phase 2 (Post-MVP): Service Extraction
```python
# New vector-store service
class VectorStoreService:
    """Dedicated service extracted from API gateway"""
    # Same interface, different deployment
```

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **MVP Speed**: No inter-service complexity initially
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Vector operations isolated in separate module
3. **Easy Migration**: Extract module to new service when ready
4. **Performance**: No network overhead during MVP phase

## Definition of Done (All Tickets)

1. **Code Quality:**
   - Unit tests with >80% coverage
   - Type hints for all functions
   - Linting passes (ruff, mypy)

2. **Integration:**
   - Works in local Docker environment
   - Deployed to staging environment
   - API documentation updated

3. **Validation:**
   - Manual testing completed
   - Performance meets requirements
   - Accessibility checked (for frontend)

## Risk Mitigation Checklist

- [ ] **Integration Risk**: Use vertical slices, test continuously
- [ ] **Scraping Risk**: Test with static samples, handle site changes gracefully
- [ ] **Deployment Risk**: Deploy daily to staging, infrastructure as code
- [ ] **Performance Risk**: Load test with realistic data volumes
- [ ] **Scope Risk**: Feature freeze July 15, one week buffer for polish

## Post-MVP Backlog (Future Sprints)

### Immediate (August 2025)
- **T50**: Extract vector operations to dedicated service
- **T51**: Advanced LLM analysis (multi-document QA)
- **T52**: User accounts and personalized recommendations

### Medium-term (September 2025)
- **T60**: Real-time speech processing pipeline
- **T61**: Advanced analytics dashboard
- **T62**: Mobile app (React Native)

### Long-term (October+ 2025)
- **T70**: AI-powered policy impact analysis
- **T71**: Multi-language support
- **T72**: Public API for third-party developers
